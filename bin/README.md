## Programs to obtain raw TE candidates
[GenomeTools](http://genometools.org/) is a versatile open-source genome analysis software that includes LTRharvest, an efficient and flexible software tool for *de novo* detection of LTR retrotransposons. `genometools-1.5.10` v1.5.10 was downloaded from [www.genometools.org](http://genometools.org/pub/binary_distributions/).

[LTR_FINDER](https://github.com/xzhub/LTR_Finder) is an efficient program for finding full-length LTR retrotranspsons in genome sequences. `LTR_FINDER_parallel` is an open-source program to run [LTR_FINDER](https://github.com/xzhub/LTR_Finder) in parallel. `LTR_FINDER_parallel` was downloaded from [LTR_FINDER_parallel](https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_FINDER_parallel).

[LTR_retriever](https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_retriever) is a highly accurate and sensitive program for identification of LTR retrotransposons. `LTR_retriever` v2.6 was downloaded from [LTR_retriever](https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_retriever).

[TIR-Learner](https://github.com/weijiaweijia/TIR-Learner-Rice) is an open-source ensemble method for TIR transposable element annotation. `TIR-Learner1.19` is a pipeline version converted from [TIR-Learner-Rice](https://github.com/weijiaweijia/TIR-Learner-Rice). The [GenericRepeatFinder](https://github.com/bioinfolabmu/GenericRepeatFinder) is used in TIR-Learner as the search engine.

[HelitronScanner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/helitronscanner/) is a Java program to identify *Helitron* transposons in genome sequences. `HelitronScanner` v1.1 was downloaded from [HelitronScanner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/helitronscanner/).

[Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF)](https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html) is a program to locate and display tandem repeats in DNA sequences. `TRF` v4.09 was downloaded from [TRF](https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html).

[TEsorter](https://github.com/zhangrengang/TEsorter) is a program for accurate classification of TEs.
